# dads_vinyls

This is a python script to scrape discogs.com, to estimate prices for my father's record collection. The website's API didn't offer historical/current prices or trends from its marketplace, and thus this script was conceived.

Note to self:
To access the database, I had to have authorization. 
This entailed creating an account (linked to google) and then generating a token through the dev tools on the webpage.
I pass this token through my app
